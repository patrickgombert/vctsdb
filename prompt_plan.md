# Time Series Database Implementation Blueprint

## Phase 1: Core Storage Foundation

### Data Structure Implementation
Implement a time series data point structure with basic validation. Create:
1. DataPoint struct with timestamp (nanoseconds), value (f64), and tags (string key-value pairs)
2. TimeSeries struct containing series name and vector of DataPoints
3. Unit tests for:
   - Data point ordering validation (strictly increasing timestamps)
   - Tag format validation (ASCII-only keys/values)
   - Empty series name prevention
4. Basic in-memory storage with thread-safe insertion
5. Error handling for invalid data points

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
Implement Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for crash recovery:
1. WAL structure that appends serialized DataPoints to disk
2. WAL segment rotation mechanism
3. Recovery method to reconstruct in-memory state from WAL
4. Unit tests for:
   - Write/read consistency
   - Crash recovery simulation
   - Segment rotation thresholds
5. Integrate with previous DataPoint structure

## Phase 2: Storage Engine

### LSM Tree Foundation
Implement LSM Tree foundation:
1. MemTable structure with sorted DataPoints (time-ordered)
2. Flush mechanism from MemTable to SSTable (disk)
3. SSTable format with columnar storage:
   - Separate timestamp/value/tags columns
   - Basic compression for timestamps (delta encoding)
4. Unit tests for:
   - MemTable capacity limits
   - SSTable persistence and loading
   - Ordered data preservation
5. Integrate with WAL system

### Time-Based Indexing
Create time-based indexing system:
1. Time range index for SSTables
2. In-memory index of active MemTable time ranges
3. Query routing mechanism that uses indexes to locate relevant data
4. Unit tests for:
   - Index update consistency
   - Time range queries
   - Overlapping range handling
5. Integrate with existing storage components

## Phase 3: Ingestion Pipeline

### Base Ingestion Interface
Implement base ingestion interface:
1. Ingestion trait with methods:
   - parse(input: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<DataPoint>>
   - supported_formats() -> Vec<&'static str>
2. JSON format implementation
3. Input validation middleware
4. Unit tests for:
   - Valid JSON parsing
   - Invalid data handling
   - Format autodetection
5. Wire to storage system with batch insertion

### Pluggable Format Support
Add pluggable format support:
1. Registry system for format handlers
2. Dynamic format detection
3. CSV format implementation
4. Unit tests for:
   - Multiple format coexistence
   - Content-type negotiation
   - Fallback parsing
5. Integrate with existing ingestion pipeline

## Phase 4: Query Foundation

### Query Parser
Implement basic query parser:
1. Lexer for custom query language
2. AST structure supporting:
   - SELECT clauses
   - WHERE conditions
   - Time range filters
3. Parser error handling
4. Unit tests for:
   - Valid query parsing
   - Syntax error detection
   - Operator precedence
5. Basic query validation

### Execution Framework
Create query execution framework:
1. Query planner that uses storage indexes
2. Executor with pipeline:
   Data collection → Filtering → Aggregation
3. Time-based windowing support
4. Unit tests for:
   - Full table scans
   - Indexed queries
   - Predicate pushdown
5. Integrate with storage engine

## Phase 5: Aggregation System

### Core Aggregations
Implement core aggregations:
1. Aggregation trait with:
   - accumulate()
   - finalize()
2. Average and Count implementations
3. Rate-of-change calculation
4. Unit tests for:
   - Partial aggregation
   - Empty dataset handling
   - Precision validation
5. Wire into query executor

### Advanced Aggregations
Add advanced aggregations:
1. Percentile calculation (T-Digest)
2. Derivative functions
3. Statistical functions (stddev, variance)
4. Unit tests for:
   - Error bounds verification
   - Streaming accuracy
   - Outlier handling
5. Integrate with query planner

## Phase 6: System Integration

### Query API Surface
Create query API surface:
1. HTTP/gRPC server foundation
2. Query endpoint with error handling
3. Response serialization (JSON/Protobuf)
4. Unit tests for:
   - End-to-end queries
   - Protocol validation
   - Error responses
5. Connect all components

### Resource Management
Implement resource management:
1. Memory pressure detection
2. Adaptive flushing strategy
3. Query cancellation
4. Unit tests for:
   - OOM prevention
   - Backpressure
   - Graceful degradation
5. Final system integration
